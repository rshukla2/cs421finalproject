		<h2>What we Do?</h2>
		<p>As part of a volunteer working group, we provide support and resources to the drivers who are wrongly given parking tickets so that they can successfully plead their case in front of a judge.</p>
		<img src="../img/parking5.jpeg" alt="Car Parking Tickets">
		<h2>Why is this issue important?</h2>
		<p>A 2018 study by WBEZ and ProPublica found that black motorists are frequently forced into a spiral of crushing ticket debt and, often, Chapter 13 bankruptcy in order to resolve that debt, restore their driverâ€™s license to good standing, and free their vehicle from impoundment. Recently, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago have taken measures to allow motorists to regain driving privileges provided their only offense is unpaid parking tickets; additionally, the city has paused the draconian debt collection measures that include garnishing state income tax rebates and forcing motorists to post thousands of dollars simply to enter into a repayment plan.</p>
		<h2>We are a volunteer group and our mission is to:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Convince motorists who have been ticketed that they can fight their ticket and potentially win. The success rate of contested tickets will obviously factor into that.</li>
			<li>Educate users on the types of violations most common in that ward and the types of allowable defenses they can use during a hearing to argue their case.</li>
			<li>Present them with an organized list of information from the city of Chicago on how to schedule their hearing as well as give them a template to follow and advice on how they can use rhetorical appeals to attempt to argue their case. Often times motorists feel intimidated by the appeals process and either pay their ticket (or, worse, ignore it) rather than attempt to argue their case in court.</li>
