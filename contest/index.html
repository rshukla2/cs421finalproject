		<p>As a registered owner of a vehicle, you have the right to contest the issuance of a parking, compliance, automated traffic law enforcement (i.e. red light) or automated speed camera enforcement violation.</p>
		<p>You have seven (7) days from the date of issuance of a parking or compliance violation to contest the ticket. If neither a contest or payment is received, a second Notice of Violation is mailed allowing twenty-one (21) days to request a hearing.</p>

		<img src="../img/parking2.png" alt="Car Parking Rhetorical Question">
		<p>If no response to the Notice of Violation is received, a Notice of Determination is mailed as notification that you have been found liable by default and have the option to petition to set aside the default judgment by appearing in person within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Determination. Once the twenty-one (21) days have lapsed, your opportunity to contest has expired. After twenty-five (25) days a Notice of Final Determination is mailed informing you that your options to challenge the ticket, both administratively and judicially, have been forfeited. A penalty equal to the amount of the fine will be assessed at that time.</p>
		<p>The Municipal Code of Chicago allows the following defenses for parking and compliance tickets. If you received a violation issued by an automated camera, and received a mailed notice with images of a vehicle registered in your name, please see the applicable defenses for Red Light and Bus Stop or Bus Lane violations.</p>
